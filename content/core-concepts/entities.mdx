# Entities

Entities are the building blocks of your ERP. They represent business objects like customers, products, invoices, or anything specific to your domain.

## What is an entity?

An entity is a structured data model with:
- **Name**: Unique identifier (e.g., "customer")
- **Fields**: Properties that define the data structure
- **Metadata**: Labels, descriptions, icons

## Field types

Cot supports rich field types:

### Primitives
- `text` - String values
- `number` - Numeric values
- `boolean` - True/false
- `date` - Date only
- `datetime` - Date and time

### Rich types
- `email` - Email with validation
- `url` - URL with validation
- `phone` - Phone number
- `currency` - Monetary values

### Relations
- `relation` - Link to another entity

### Advanced
- `select` - Dropdown with options
- `json` - Arbitrary JSON data
- `computed` - Calculated fields

## Example: Project entity

\`\`\`typescript
const project = await cot.entities.create({
  name: "project",
  label: "Project",
  pluralLabel: "Projects",
  description: "Building projects for construction management",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "title",
      type: "text",
      required: true,
      label: "Project Title",
    },
    {
      name: "budget",
      type: "currency",
      currency: "USD",
      label: "Budget",
    },
    {
      name: "start_date",
      type: "date",
      label: "Start Date",
    },
    {
      name: "status",
      type: "select",
      options: [
        { label: "Planning", value: "planning" },
        { label: "Active", value: "active" },
        { label: "Complete", value: "complete" },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
\`\`\`

This creates a complete data model with validation, API endpoints, and UI.

## Best practices

- Use lowercase with underscores for entity names
- Keep entities focused (single responsibility)
- Define required fields carefully
- Use descriptive labels for the UI
