# Quickstart

Get started with Cot in 5 minutes.

## What is Cot?

Cot is an API-first platform for building custom ERP systems. Think of it as a foundation that lets you define your business objects (entities), and automatically generates:

- REST APIs
- Database schemas
- Admin UI
- Type-safe SDKs

## Create your first entity

Define a "customer" entity with just a few fields:

\`\`\`typescript
const customer = await cot.entities.create({
  name: "customer",
  label: "Customer",
  fields: [
    { name: "name", type: "text", required: true },
    { name: "email", type: "email", required: true, unique: true },
    { name: "phone", type: "phone" },
  ],
});
\`\`\`

That's it! Cot automatically:
- Creates a Postgres table for storing customers
- Generates REST endpoints at `/v1/data/customer`
- Provides a type-safe SDK
- Creates admin UI forms

## Use the API

Create a customer via the API:

\`\`\`bash
curl https://api.cot.dev/v1/data/customer \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890"
  }'
\`\`\`

Query customers:

\`\`\`bash
curl https://api.cot.dev/v1/data/customer \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
\`\`\`
