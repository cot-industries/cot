# Cot Positioning - Quick Reference

## What We Are

**"AI-First Business Software Platform"**

The infrastructure layer that AI agents use to build and deploy business software.

---

## What We're Not

❌ **Not an ERP** - Too narrow, legacy connotation  
❌ **Not no-code** - We're developer/agent infrastructure  
❌ **Not end-user software** - We're a platform for building products  
❌ **Not another Notion/Airtable** - Different layer entirely

## Analogies That Work

### Infrastructure Analogy
- **Stripe** : Payments :: **Cot** : Business Operations
- **Neon** : Database :: **Cot** : Business Logic
- **Clerk** : Auth :: **Cot** : Entities/Workflows

### Layer Analogy
- **AWS** : Infrastructure :: **Cot** : Business Software
- **Notion** : End-user tool :: **Cot** : Developer platform

### Agent Analogy
- **Cursor** : Code editor for AI :: **Cot** : Deployment platform for AI
- **GitHub Copilot** : Writes code :: **Cot Agent** : Deploys infrastructure

## One-Sentence Descriptions (Test These)

### For Developers
"The API that turns entity definitions into working business software."

### For AI Agents  
"The execution layer - I design entities, you deploy infrastructure."

### For Investors
"Stripe for business operations - API-first, AI-native, Vercel ecosystem."

### For Press
"The platform that turns AI conversations into deployed business software."

---

## Target Audiences (Priority Order)

### 1. AI Agents (Primary)
- Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, v0, etc.
- They need: API, clear schema, predictable behavior
- Value prop: Deploy infrastructure they generate

### 2. Developers (Secondary)
- Building SaaS products, need backend fast
- They need: SDK, docs, examples
- Value prop: Ship 10x faster

### 3. Dev Shops/Agencies (Tertiary)
- Building client projects repeatedly
- They need: Templates, white-label
- Value prop: Standardize delivery

### 4. Enterprise (Future)
- Custom internal software
- They need: Security, compliance, SLAs
- Value prop: Modern alternative to legacy systems

---

## Competitive Positioning

### We Win On:
1. **API-First** - Everything via API (agents can use it)
2. **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript, Drizzle ORM
3. **Modern Stack** - Next.js 16, React 19, Postgres
4. **Vercel Ecosystem** - Native integration
5. **Agent-Friendly** - Designed for LLM generation

### We Don't Compete On:
- Visual UI builder (use Retool for that)
- End-user features (use Notion for that)
- Generic backend (use Supabase for that)
- Legacy enterprise (use SAP for that)

### Our Niche:
**Developer/Agent infrastructure for business software in the Vercel ecosystem**

---

## Messaging Framework

### Problem
"Building business software takes months. LLMs can write code, but can't deploy infrastructure."

### Solution  
"Cot is the platform AI agents use to deploy business software. Define entities, get APIs + DB + UI instantly."

### Proof
"Used by developers building [CRM, inventory, HR] systems. Ships in hours, not months."

### Call-to-Action
"Start free at cot.dev. Try with Claude/Cursor/v0 today."

---

## Vertical Positioning (Examples)

### Construction
"Cot for construction: API-first project management, Australian compliance built-in."

### Healthcare
"Cot for healthcare: HIPAA-compliant patient management, generated by AI."

### Real Estate
"Cot for real estate: Property + client + inspection entities, ready in minutes."

---

## Brand Voice

### We Are:
- **Technical** - For developers, not marketers
- **Concise** - No fluff, Stripe-quality docs
- **Future-focused** - AI-first, not AI-added
- **Pragmatic** - Solve real problems, not hype

### We're Not:
- Corporate/enterprise language
- No-code marketing speak
- Overpromising vaporware
- Following trends blindly

---

## Key Differentiators

1. **Agent-Native Design**
   - API designed for programmatic generation
   - Validation that catches LLM mistakes
   - Idempotent operations

2. **Vercel Ecosystem**
   - Built on Next.js 16 (latest)
   - Deploys to Vercel edge
   - Integrates with marketplace

3. **Type-Safety**
   - Zod schemas everywhere
   - Drizzle ORM (not Prisma)
   - Full TypeScript, no `any`

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Stripe-quality docs
   - Working examples
   - Infrastructure as code

---

## Pricing Positioning

### Free Tier (Agent Testing)
"Try with AI agents free. 3 entities, 10k API calls/month."

### Pro Tier ($99/mo)
"For production apps. Unlimited entities, 1M API calls."

### Enterprise (Custom)
"White-label agent, custom compliance, SLAs."

**Key:** Make it free enough for AI agents to experiment, paid for production.

## When They Ask: "What's Cot?"

### 30 Second Answer
"Cot is a platform for building business software. You define entities like 'customer' or 'invoice', and we generate the database, API, and UI automatically. It's designed for developers and AI agents building in the Vercel ecosystem. Think Stripe for payments, but for business operations."

### 2 Minute Answer
"So in 2025, AI can write code, but it can't deploy infrastructure. You can ask Claude to build a CRM, and it'll generate the code, but you still have to manually set up the database, API routes, authentication, etc.

Cot solves that. We're an API-first platform where you define your data entities - like 'customer', 'order', 'invoice' - and we automatically create:
- Postgres tables with proper types
- REST APIs with full CRUD
- Admin dashboard for data management
- Type-safe SDK for your Next.js app

It's designed to work with AI agents. Claude or Cursor can call our API directly and deploy working business software. No manual infrastructure setup needed.

We're positioning as infrastructure - like how Stripe is infrastructure for payments, or Clerk for auth, we're infrastructure for business operations. Built on Next.js 16, integrated with the Vercel ecosystem.

Currently in beta, launching publicly next month."
